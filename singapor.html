    <h1>HELLO  SINGAPOR</h1>

<div id="hero">
    <h1>Singapore (Singapura, 新加坡, சிங்கப்பூர்) is a cosmopolitan city-state in Southeast Asia that became independent from the British in 1965 and is now one of the world’s leading economic centers in shipping and banking</h1>
    <p>Singaporean food is legendary, with bustling hawker centres and 24-hour coffee shops offering cheap food from all parts of Asia, and shoppers can bust their baggage allowances in shopping centres like Orchard Road and Suntec City. In recent years some societal restrictions have also loosened up, and now you can bungee jump and dance on bar tops all night long, although alcohol is still very pricey and chewing gum can only be bought from a pharmacy for medical use.</p>
    <p>Two casino complexes — or "Integrated Resorts", to use the Singaporean euphemism — opened in 2010 in Sentosa and Marina Bay as part of Singapore's new Fun and Entertainment drive, the aim being to double the number of tourists visiting and increase the length of time they stay within the country. See Do, Gambling, below.</p>
